                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <hr>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Make tartar sauce:</strong> Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 500°F. Pour flour onto a small tray or a wide bowl and add at least 1 tbsp salt, and pepper to taste. Beat eggs with 3 tablespoons water and place in another wide bowl. Add crushed cornflakes to a third tray. Salt and pepper fish generously, then dredge first in the flour, then egg mixture, then roll in cornflakes. Place fillets on the wire rack of a foil-lined baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Bake in a preheated 500°F oven until fish is just cooked through and flaky, 10-12 minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>To make in air fryer:</strong> Arrange as many fillets as will fit comfortably in the basket of an air fryer and cook at 400°F, 4 to 6 minutes, turning halfway.</li>
                </ol>
